## What is an organization?

An organization in Nocotax represents a business entity - either a company or an individual person. Every organization can participate in transactions as either a buyer or seller of goods and services.

Organizations are the foundation of invoicing in Nocotax:
- Every invoice has a **supplier** (seller) and **customer** (buyer)
- Both are represented as organizations
- Organizations track tax registrations, addresses, and balances

## Organization types: self vs external

Every organization has an `ownership` field that determines its type:

### Your organizations (ownership=self)

This are **your platform's business entities**. You currently have one self organization per mode (testmode and livemode).

```bash
# Your organization is automatically created during onboarding
curl https://api.nocotax.app/organizations?ownership=self \
  -u ${ACCOUNT_ID}:${YOUR_API_KEY}
```

**Characteristics**:
- Represents your company
- Only one per mode (for the moment)
- Cannot be deleted
- Where you configure your tax registrations
- Your identity on invoices

### External organizations (ownership=external)

These are **the entities you do business with** - your customers and suppliers.

```bash
# Create an external organization
curl https://api.nocotax.app/organizations \
  -u ${ACCOUNT_ID}:${YOUR_API_KEY} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "roles": ["BUYER"],
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "billing_address": {
      "country": "FR"
    }
  }'
```

**Characteristics**:
- Represent customers, suppliers, partners
- Unlimited number
- Can be created, updated, deleted
- Each has specific roles
- Can have their own tax registrations

## Organization roles

External organizations have roles that define their relationship with your platform:

### BUYER role

Organizations you sell to. They buy from your platform.

```bash
curl https://api.nocotax.app/organizations \
  -u ${ACCOUNT_ID}:${YOUR_API_KEY} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "roles": ["BUYER"],
    "name": "Customer Inc",
    "billing_address": {
      "country": "FR"
    }
  }'
```

**Used for**:
- Sales invoices (you invoice them)
- Tracking accounts receivable (money owed to you)
- Customer management

### MERCHANT role

Organizations you buy from - your suppliers, vendors, or marketplace sellers.

```bash
curl https://api.nocotax.app/organizations \
  -u ${ACCOUNT_ID}:${YOUR_API_KEY} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "roles": ["MERCHANT"],
    "name": "Supplier Co",
    "billing_address": {
      "country": "FR"
    }
  }'
```

**Used for**:
- Purchase invoices (they invoice you, or you self-bill)
- Tracking accounts payable (money you owe them)
- Supplier management
- Marketplace seller payouts

### Both roles

An organization can have both CUSTOMER and MERCHANT roles simultaneously:

```bash
curl https://api.nocotax.app/organizations \
  -u ${ACCOUNT_ID}:${YOUR_API_KEY} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "roles": ["CUSTOMER", "MERCHANT"],
    "name": "Partner Company",
    "billing_address": {
      "country": "FR"
    }
  }'
```

**Example**: A business partner where you both buy services from them and sell services to them.

<Note>
The role determines what the organization **can** do, not what they're actively doing. You can set the role even before any transactions occur.
</Note>

## Organizations in invoicing

Organizations play two positions on every invoice: supplier and customer.

### The supplier_id

The organization providing goods or services (the seller).

**In sales invoices**: Usually your platform
```bash
curl https://api.nocotax.app/invoices \
  -u ${ACCOUNT_ID}:${YOUR_API_KEY} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "flow": "sales",
    "customer_id": "org_customer_123", // Supplier ID is your platform
    "items": [...]
  }'
```

**In purchase invoices**: The external supplier
```bash
curl https://api.nocotax.app/invoices \
  -u ${ACCOUNT_ID}:${YOUR_API_KEY} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "flow": "purchases",
    "supplier_id": "org_supplier_456", // Customer ID is your platform
    "items": [...]
  }'
```

### The customer_id

The organization receiving goods or services (the buyer).

**In sales invoices**: Your customer
```bash
# supplier_id = your platform
# customer_id = your customer
```

**In purchase invoices**: Your platform
```bash
# supplier_id = external supplier
# customer_id = your platform
```

### Role vs position

| Role | Can be supplier_id? | Can be customer_id? |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Your platform (self) | ✓ Yes (sales) | ✓ Yes (purchases) |
| BUYER | ✗ No* | ✓ Yes |
| MERCHANT | ✓ Yes | ✗ Yes** |
| Both roles | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes |

*Unless the organization has both roles
** In commission model

<Warning>
An organization must have the appropriate role for its position on the invoice:
- To be a `supplier_id`: needs MERCHANT role (or be your platform)
- To be a `customer_id`: needs BUYER or MERCHANT role (or be your platform)
</Warning>


## Organization hierarchy

```
Account
  ├── Mode: testmode
  │     ├── Organizations (ownership=self) - Your platform
  │     └── Organizations (ownership=external)
  │           ├── BUYER orgs
  │           ├── MERCHANT orgs
  │           └── Dual-role orgs
  │
  └── Mode: livemode
        ├── Organizations (ownership=self) - Your platform
        └── Organizations (ownership=external)
              ├── BUYER orgs
              ├── MERCHANT orgs
              └── Dual-role orgs
```

Data is completely isolated between testmode and livemode.

## Common patterns

### E-commerce platform
- Your platform: `ownership=self`
- Customers: `ownership=external`, `role=BUYER`
- Invoices: You → Customers (sales flow)

### Marketplace (commission agent)
- Your platform: `ownership=self`
- Sellers: `ownership=external`, `role=MERCHANT`
- Buyers: `ownership=external`, `role=BUYER`
- Commission invoices: Your platform → Sellers (commission flow)
- Optional: Sellers → Buyers (white label invoicing)

### Buy and resell (undisclosed agent)
- Your platform: `ownership=self`
- Suppliers: `ownership=external`, `role=MERCHANT`
- Customers: `ownership=external`, `role=CUSTOMER`
- Purchase invoices: Suppliers → Your platform (purchases flow)
- Sales invoices: Your platform → Customers (sales flow)

### Service platform with suppliers
- Your platform: `ownership=self`
- Service providers: `ownership=external`, `role=MERCHANT`
- Customers: `ownership=external`, `role=CUSTOMER`
- May need dual-role if providers also buy services from you

## Key attributes

Every organization can have:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `name` | Full legal entity name (business or person) |
| `billing_address` | Invoicing address |
| `tax_registrations[]` | List of tax registrations |

See [Tax Registrations](/billing-invoicing/organizations/tax-registrations) for detailed attribute information.

## Best practices

- Set clear, descriptive names for easy identification
- Assign roles when creating organizations, even before first transaction
- Use dual roles for partners you both buy from and sell to
- Keep tax numbers and addresses updated
- Use metadata to link to external systems (Stripe, CRM, etc.)
