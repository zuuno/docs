## Get started in three steps

Get Nocotax API running locally and make your first API calls.

### Step 1: Create your Nocotax account and finish the setup process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create your Nocotax account" icon="rocket">
    
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Finish the setup process" icon="palette">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!

### Step 2: Send your first API request

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Retrieve your API credentials" icon="copy">
    By default, all accounts have a total of three API credentials:

    | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `Account ID`   | An unique ID referencing your account. It's used in the Basic Auth Scheme for API requests as the ID credential.                                                                                                                                                |
    | `Test API Key` | Authenticate requests on your server when you’re testing in a sandbox. By default, you can use this key to perform any API request without restriction. Reserve this key for testing and development to make sure you don’t accidentally modify your live data. |
    | `Live API Key` | Authenticate requests on your server when in live mode. Don’t expose this key on a website or embed it in a mobile application. You can only use this key to perform any API request after subscribing to a paid plan                                           |

    Your credentials are stored on the [Developers settings](https://app.nocotax.app/settings/developers/credentials) tab in the dashboard.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create a sample organization in Sandbox" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    You can begin exploring Nocotax APIs using the HTTPs client of your choice (curl, postman...), along with your API keys (see below).

    Operating in sandbox environment, you don't have to worry about altering production data when doing the following tests.

    1. To create an organization using the Nocotax API, send the following API request

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.nocotax.app/organizations \
    -u ${ACCOUNT_ID}:${TEST_API_KEY} \
    -d 'name=Test Customer' \
    -d 'roles[]=BUYER' \
    -d 'billing_address[country]=FR'
    ```

    2. If everything worked, you should see a response, with a JSON body embeded, containing the ID of the newly created organization:

       ```json
       {
       	"id": "org_xxxxxxxxxxxx",
       	"object": "organization",
       	// ...
       }
       
       ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
